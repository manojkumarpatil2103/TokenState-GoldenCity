## Test Cases Results

ðŸ§ª Frontend Testing

The frontend of this application has been thoroughly tested using Jest along with React Testing Library to ensure UI components render correctly and behave as expected.

âœ… Testing Highlights

Component Rendering: Verified that all major sections (Hero, Stats, Mission, Team, Cryptocurrencies, Awards) render correctly.

Content Verification: Checked that key headings, descriptions, stats, and text content are displayed accurately.

Icons & Images: Ensured that all icons (from react-icons) and images (both local and external) appear correctly and have appropriate alt attributes for accessibility.

Layout & Styling: Confirmed responsive layouts and Tailwind CSS classes for grids, headings, and sections to ensure proper display across devices.

Accessibility: Validated semantic HTML structure, heading hierarchy, and presence of alt attributes on all images.

Error Handling & Resilience: Tested edge cases such as missing images and verified that the component renders without throwing errors.

Performance: Checked that all sections render efficiently and key text content is available synchronously.

âš¡ Tools Used

Jest: For running test suites and assertions.

React Testing Library: For DOM testing and simulating user interactions.

Mocks: External libraries such as react-icons and framer-motion were mocked to isolate the component logic and focus on rendering correctness.

These tests provide confidence that the frontend is robust, accessible, and responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience.
